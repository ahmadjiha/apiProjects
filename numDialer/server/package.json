Dial three numbers simultaneously at all times (unless less than three numbers left).   - When a phone call finishes, dial the next number in the list (in order). 2. Dial by the order they are given. 3. This logic must be in the back-end.   - Client cannot initiate more than 3 calls at a time.   - Client cannot dial numbers outside of list.   - Client cannot dial numbers out of order. 4. No database. Maintain state of calls in memory. 5. One user and the user only dials down the list a single time.",
